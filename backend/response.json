When AI algorithms take on cognitive work with social dimensions, they inherit the social requirements. It is therefore important to develop AI algorithms that are not just powerful and scalable, but also transparent to inspection, predictable to those they govern, robust against manipulation and more. This paper explores some of these challenges and what an increasingly computerized society should be thinking about.", {"api_version": {"version": "1"}, "billed_units": {"input_tokens": 1186, "output_tokens": 88}}]
